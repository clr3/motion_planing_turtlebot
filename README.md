Using potential field aproach

Objectives: 
The objectives of this assignment is to equip the robot with a reactive motion planning algorithm that you will design. 
The algorithm should take a goal position in 2D space as argument and derive velocity and/or position commands to drive the vehicle towards the goal whilst avoiding obstacles. 
We will assume that we have no-prior map of the environment and that the algorithm is only reacting to live measurements of the laser scanner. You can however envisage to store the environment in a grid cased system to record obstacles (and memorize them) when you find them.
